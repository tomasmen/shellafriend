## Restructuring Code

- Find where variables are imported and instead pass them into functions that need (physics.ts imports localPlayer and remotePlayesr arr for example)

- Instead of clumping all classes / codes maybe its worth considering keeping hem in related files instead (e.g. weapons.ts doesnt have WeaponId and WeaponDef), for now its fine but might cause unnecessary file jumping later
